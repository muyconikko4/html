                                <p>I was the designer and front-end developer for
                                the initial Pet Plate website in 2015 and
                                worked closely with the company as it grew
                                over a period of 5 years, eventually becoming
                                Lead Front-end Developer. By early 2020,
                                Pet Plate had successfully raised a total
                                investment fund of $13 million dollars.</p>

                                the LSU - Football Operations Facility Expansion. 
                                The project required solutions to produce a website 
                                that matched the detailed designs and interactivity 
                                concepts provided by Red Six Media whilst remaining

                <p>CSS3 Foundations is a book I wrote in 2012 
                guiding readers through the process of using
                CSS3 features and techniques to take a basic
                 website template and turn it into a real-
                 world, modern and future proof website. It was published in paperback and digital
                 formats by Wiley and later translated to 
                 Chinese. It was well received with a review
                 score of 4.5 out of 5 on Amazon.</p>
